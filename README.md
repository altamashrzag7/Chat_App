A lightweight, real-time chat app that lets two users converse over a LAN/Wi-Fi while a central server is running. The project pairs a simple, friendly Tkinter interface with Pythonâ€™s socket programming and threading to deliver instant messaging with minimal setup.

Two-person live chat: Connect two clients to an active server and exchange messages instantly.

Clean desktop UI: Tkinter windows with a scrollable chat history, typing area, and send controls.

Non-blocking experience: Background threads handle network I/O so the UI never freezes.

Status awareness: Connection state (Connected/Disconnected), server host/port, and graceful shutdowns.
